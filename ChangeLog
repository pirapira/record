	Eth effect useful under a particular design pattern, where any send failures would abort the whole program execution.
	The Eth condition can be strengthened so that it guarantees, after one call fails no subsequent calls would happen.

	256 bit calculus -> 64 bit calculus measn everything has to be done four times.
	This kind of problem is a good target for Isabelle/HOL, for instance.

	This means
	- there should be a way to translate state diagram into executables
	- need of off-chain, on-chain integration
	  (maybe some partial evaluation type systems)

	* dry: added arithmetic instructions
	https://github.com/pirapira/dry-analyzer/issues/6

	* cpp-ethereum: created #3287

	* solidity: reviewed #994 and #993

	* general: created a list of projects with merits/time points.

	* dry: created issues for missing opcodes.

	* ../go-ethereum/eth/api.go: TraceTransaction
	I came up with an idea of annotating vm.trace with the origins of the values on the stack.
	Maybe this would add {op_arg_origin: [{step: 6, desc: "CALLER"}]} in each step.
	http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/4282/how-to-check-the-vm-trace-using-geth
	So, created a github issue about it.  https://github.com/pirapira/dry-analyzer/issues/11

	* general: on Gitter, explained the trade off between the bytecode verification and Solidity verification
	bytecode has ease of verification, and the trustworthiness of the result
	Solidity has readability

	* ewasm: WASM semantics in K system
	https://github.com/kframework/wasm-semantics
	looks small.  Is this the whole language?

	* why3: lively discussion on Gitter
	@mrsmkl shortened the why3-token file
	"why3" tactic not working with Coq 8.5
	@leonardoalt SeaHorn and CPAChecker might be able to prove invariants
	Think about Solidity -> LLVM and what can be done

	* dry: got a pull-request from @tomsib2001

	* env: got a chair and a desk at home.

	* dry: Dr. Y's anayzer out in reddit.  Got some feedbacks.  Need to implement all instructions.

	* why3: double_wp module
	A formalization of a stack machine.  Possible to verify bytecode fragments and then compose them.

	* ../evmverif/why3: started formalizing EVM in Why3

	* why3: removed all unwanted axioms from token.mlw
	https://github.com/pirapira/token_why3/blob/master/token.mlw#L167

	* read: TALx86

	* ../solidity/libsolidity/ast/ASTForward.h (dev): a definition can appear in using A = B

	* emacs: M-. and then M-*

	* ../solidity/libsolidity/interface/InterfaceHandler.cpp (abiInterface): review #996
	https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/996

	* emacs: configured C++ reading environment
	http://tuhdo.github.io/c-ide.html

	* comm: had a look at a thesis
	http://www.diku.dk/hjemmesider/ansatte/hvitved/publications/hvitved12phd.pdf

	* comm: made some comments on the announcement
	https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/50ojqr/new_blog_post_dev_update_formal_methods/

	* emacs: configured a keyboard macro for adding an entry here
	;; http://0xcc.net/unimag/1/
	(defun memo ()
	  (interactive)
	  (add-change-log-entry
	    nil
	    (expand-file-name "~/src/record/ChangeLog")))
	(setq add-log-full-name "Yoichi Hirai"
	  add-log-mailing-address "yoichi@ethereum.org")
	(global-set-key (kbd "M-l") 'memo)

2016-09-01  Yoichi Hirai  <yoichi@ethereum.org>

	* why3: writing token.mlw
	https://github.com/pirapira/token_why3

	* comm: discussion with @chriseth
	Which direction we are heading
	What to look at

	* comm: joined many channels
